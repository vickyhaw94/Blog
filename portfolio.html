			<h3>Mix Up Your Mood</h3>
			<p>he project described in this document was designed and created as part of UQ’s Design Thinking (DECO1100) course. The project required us to work in small groups to develop an interactive system for UQ’s St Lucia campus that could engage campus visitors’ interest concerning some intangible aspect of the campus and its people. Specifically, the core feature of our product was the capacity to measure a particular intangible aspect of the campus from interactions with its users while at the same time returning collected information of this intangible feature back in an engaging, interactive and thought- provoking manner. Additional requirements of our product that helped to guide our design process and concept development was that it needed to be multi-user, be a good product, be possible, employ interaction design principals, be targeted and specific, be self-sufficient and self-explanatory, be original and be physical.</p>
