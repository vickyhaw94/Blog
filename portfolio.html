			<h3>Capture Your Flag</h3>
			<p>FlagTrix is a mobile iOS game that utilizes GPS technology. It is a multiplayer game that requires at least four people to play in a 2v2 game and up to six people in a 3v3 game. FlagTrix bridges the gap between computer games and real world actions with GPS. The rules of the game are simple; get to your opponent's base and steal their flag, once stolen, return their flag to your own base for a point. Get three points and your team wins the game. The rules are simple, intuitive and easy to understand and as such the game is incredibly versatile. Many people choose to augment the game with additional rules enforced outside of the mobile app which provides an extra layer of enjoyment.</p>

				<h3>Mix Up Your Mood</h3>
				<p>he project described in this document was designed and created as part of UQ’s Design Thinking (DECO1100) course. The project required us to work in small groups to develop an interactive system for UQ’s St Lucia campus that could engage campus visitors’ interest concerning some intangible aspect of the campus and its people. Specifically, the core feature of our product was the capacity to measure a particular intangible aspect of the campus from interactions with its users while at the same time returning collected information of this intangible feature back in an engaging, interactive and thought- provoking manner. Additional requirements of our product that helped to guide our design process and concept development was that it needed to be multi-user, be a good product, be possible, employ interaction design principals, be targeted and specific, be self-sufficient and self-explanatory, be original and be physical.</p>

			<h3>Web Tech</h3>
			<p>The primary objective of this website is to allow people to actually know how does the HTML, CSS and JavaScript combine together to build a website. There are two examples in this website which include slideshow and auto-generate a table. The second objective is to record some of the learning processes and includes technical summary which can directly reflect learning obstacles. Other than that, I also hope that I am able to write more interesting topic to help other people as well.
